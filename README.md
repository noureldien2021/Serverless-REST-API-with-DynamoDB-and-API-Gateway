# Solution Overview

**Description**
Create a serverless image processing application where users upload images to an S3 bucket, triggering an AWS Lambda function that processes and resizes the images before storing them in another S3 bucket.

**Key AWS Services Used**

1. Amazon S3: Stores original and processed images.
2. AWS Lambda: Executes image processing (resize, watermarking).
3. Amazon DynamoDB: Store metadata about uploaded images.

# AWS Services Used

#### Amazon S3

1. S3 stores data as **objects**.  
2. SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption) â†’ AWS manages the keys (default option).
3. In this project, S3 stores both **original uploaded images** and **processed images** in separate buckets.
4. S3 integrates seamlessly with Lambda to **trigger image processing automatically** when a new file is uploaded.


#### AWS Lambda

1. AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that runs your code without provisioning or managing servers.
2. In this project, Lambda is **triggered automatically** when a new image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
3. It performs **image processing tasks** such as resizing and watermarking.
4. **Requires IAM role permissions** to access the source and destination S3 buckets.


#### Amazon DynamoDB
1. Amazon DynamoDB is a **fully managed NoSQL database** that provides fast and predictable performance.
2. In this project, DynamoDB is used to **store metadata** about uploaded images (e.g., filename, size, timestamp).


# WorkFlow
1. Upload image to source S3 bucket.  
2. Lambda is triggered automatically.  
3. Image is processed (resize, watermark).  
4. Processed image is saved to destination bucket.  
5. Metadata is saved to DynamoDB (optional).  

# Learning Outcomes
1. Building event-driven architectures with Lambda and S3 triggers.
2. Understanding cost-efficient, auto-scaling serverless applications.
3. Enhancing security using IAM roles and S3 bucket policies.
