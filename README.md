# Solution Overview

**Description**
Develop a serverless REST API using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB to manage a simple to-do list or customer records. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data without managing servers.


**Key AWS Services Used**

1. Amazon API Gateway: Exposes REST endpoints.
2. AWS Lambda: Handles API requests (CRUD operations).
3. Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database for storing records.
4. AWS IAM: Controls access via roles and permissions.
5. Amazon CloudWatch: Logs and monitors API activity.
6. S3: to host the front-end of your application

# AWS Services Used

#### Amazon-API-Gateway

1. S3 stores data as **objects**.  
2. SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption) â†’ AWS manages the keys (default option).
3. In this project, S3 stores both **original uploaded images** and **processed images** in separate buckets.
4. S3 integrates seamlessly with Lambda to **trigger image processing automatically** when a new file is uploaded.


#### AWS Lambda

1. AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that runs your code without provisioning or managing servers.
2. In this project, Lambda is **triggered automatically** when a new image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
3. It performs **image processing tasks** such as resizing and watermarking.
4. **Requires IAM role permissions** to access the source and destination S3 buckets.


#### Amazon DynamoDB
1. Amazon DynamoDB is a **fully managed NoSQL database** that provides fast and predictable performance.
2. In this project, DynamoDB is used to **store metadata** about uploaded images (e.g., filename, size, timestamp).


#### AWS IAM
1. Amazon DynamoDB is a **fully managed NoSQL database** that provides fast and predictable performance.
2. In this project, DynamoDB is used to **store metadata** about uploaded images (e.g., filename, size, timestamp).


#### Amazon CloudWatch
1. Amazon DynamoDB is a **fully managed NoSQL database** that provides fast and predictable performance.
2. In this project, DynamoDB is used to **store metadata** about uploaded images (e.g., filename, size, timestamp).


#### Amazon S3
1. Amazon DynamoDB is a **fully managed NoSQL database** that provides fast and predictable performance.
2. In this project, DynamoDB is used to **store metadata** about uploaded images (e.g., filename, size, timestamp).

# WorkFlow
1. Upload image to source S3 bucket.  
2. Lambda is triggered automatically.  
3. Image is processed (resize, watermark).  
4. Processed image is saved to destination bucket.  
5. Metadata is saved to DynamoDB (optional).  

# Learning Outcomes
1. Designing scalable, event-driven serverless applications.
2. Implementing API Gateway with Lambda for stateless execution
3. Using DynamoDB as a managed NoSQL database with best practices.
4. Securing APIs with IAM roles and resource policies.
